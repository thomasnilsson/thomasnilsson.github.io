			<p><b>About</b><br>I am passionated about software
				engineering and data. I work at
				the
				Danish health-tech company, <a href="https://www.monsenso.com/">Monsenso</a>. My entrance into
				health-tech was in 2017 when I started the company <i>Edea IT</i> with a fellow student, in which we
				developed which
				provided web- and mobile solutions for patient studies in hospital clinics.</p>

			<p><b>Studying Abroad</b><br>In the spring of 2020 I studied
				in
				Munich, Germany and prior to that I spent an
				exchange semester at
				ETH Zurich in Switzerland.</p>

			<p><b>Open-source Contributions</b><br>My main contributions
				are
				in
				the <a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/cachet.dk/packages">CACHET
					Flutter
					plugin collection</a> where I authored the very popular <a
					href="https://pub.dev/packages/health">Health
					plugin.</a></p>

				<p><b>Minimalism</b><br>
					I moved into my own apartment in 2020 and I find that being limited on physical space really speaks
					to
					the need for minimalism with physical objects. The process of furnishing the apartment, sparingly,
					with
					a focus on utilizing the space efficiently I find very enjoyable. However I find that this also
					carries
					out into the rest of my life; I try not to have too many things going on at the same time, to avoid
					stress and clutter. This website if also just a single HTML page on purpose.

				<p><b>Music</b><br>
					I currently produce hardstyle under the alias, Resonate. I have listened to hardstyle since 2008 on
					a daily basis, and started out producing in Reason in 2011 on a very on and off basis (mostly off).
					However it wasn't until recently that I decided to step up my game and seek out guidance from
					another producer, Eternize, who turned out to live only 15 minutes away.
