			<p><b>About</b><br>I am passionated about software
				engineering and data. I work at
				the
				Danish health-tech company, <a href="https://www.monsenso.com/">Monsenso</a>. My entrance into
				health-tech was in 2017 when I started the company <i>Edea IT</i> with a fellow student, in which we
				developed which
				provided web- and mobile solutions for patient studies in hospital clinics.</p>


			<p><b>Open-source Contributions</b><br>My main contributions
				are
				in
				the <a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/cachet.dk/packages">CACHET
					Flutter
					plugin collection</a> where I authored the very popular <a
					href="https://pub.dev/packages/health">Health
					plugin.</a></p>

				<p><b>Minimalism</b><br>
					In 2018 I discovered minimalism through the internet and used it to prepare for moving to
					Switzerland in 2019. At the time I lived in a small room at a dorm, and already lived with a minimal
					set of items

				<p>I moved into my own apartment in 2020 and I find that even though I now have a real apartment for
					myself, I don't need many things in it. I find the process of furnishing the apartment, sparingly,
					with a focus on only bringing in essential items inside the door very enoyable, and carthagic.</p>

				<p><b>Music</b><br>
					I currently produce hardstyle under the alias, Resonate. I have listened to hardstyle since 2008 on
					a daily basis, and started out producing in Reason in 2011 on a very on and off basis (mostly off).
					However it wasn't until recently that I decided to take it to the next level by seeking out guidance from
					another producer.
